### **Explanation of the Components**
1. **User**: Represents the person accessing your "Code Me" platform.
2. **Frontend (Browser)**: The interface where users interact with your site, typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. **Backend (Flask Server)**: The Python-based backend that processes requests and manages logic.
4. **Database**: Stores user data, progress, and other critical information.
5. **Static File Storage**: Holds static assets like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.
6. **Data Flow**:
   - Users send requests via the browser.
   - Backend processes these requests, fetching or updating data from the database.
   - Static files are served directly to the frontend for performance.
